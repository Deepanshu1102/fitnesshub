          <p>Squats are a compound exercise that targets the lower body, including the quadriceps, hamstrings, glutes, and calves. They are performed by bending at the knees and hips, keeping the back straight, and lowering the body towards the ground. Squats are considered one of the most effective exercises for building leg strength, improving lower body mobility, and enhancing overall lower body power and athleticism.</p>
